# AK47 Card Game In Python

AK47 is a card game played by two or more players where each player strives to have the cards with ranks A, K, 4, and 7 independent of the suit.

## How it is played

A deck of 52 cards is used.

1. Each player is dealt with 4 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down and used as the draw pile.
2. Any player can start the game. The player drops a card to the discard pile and draws a card from the draw pile in each turn. The card dropped is the one the player does not feel it would form the required set (AK47). The card can be of other rank or an excess of the required cards.
